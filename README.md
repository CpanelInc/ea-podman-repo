# What is this package for?

It ensures that CentOS 7, AlmaLinux 8, and Ubuntu 20.04 have access to a `podman` that `ea-podman` requires.

It is not available on OSs that do not need it.

## I didnâ€™t realize that and undid the configuration that it setup!

No problem, just run `/opt/cpanel/ea-podman-repo/initrepo.sh` and follow any instructions.
